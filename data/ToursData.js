              after the war in the Tigray region. You will undertake a memorable trek to the top of the active volcano Erta Ale before discovering 
              the alien salt landscapes of Dallol. The Danakil Depression lies between the Danakil Alps (east) and the Ethiopian Plateau (west), 
              which were once joined until the rifting process tore them apart. The land surface is slowly sinking, and the Danakil Depression will 
              someday fill with water as a new ocean or great lake is born. The Danakil Depression is one of the lowest areas below sea level and is 
              also the hottest point on Earth as far as the year-round average temperatures are considered. Known by the Afar as the “smoking mountain” 
              and “the gateway to hell,” Erta Ale is a 2,011-foot-high constantly active basaltic shield volcano. It is one of only a handful of 
              continuously active volcanoes in the world, and a member of an even more exclusive group: volcanoes with lava lakes. While there 
              are only five known volcanoes with lava lakes globally, Erta Ale often has two active lava lakes – making it a unique site. Dallol 
              has some of the most colorful landscapes on Earth.

      five centuries. The monastery's chief abbot, known as the Ichege, was the second-ranking member of the entire Ethiopian Church. Tekle 
      Haymanot was a notable political and religious figure. He contributed significantly to the propagation of Christianity in the region 
      and the restoration of the Solomonic dynasty's rule, which had been absent for several centuries. The monastery complex is situated 
      on a terrace that lies between a cliff and the gorge of one of the tributaries of the Blue Nile. Today, the site exudes a calm, serene 
      atmosphere, surrounded by pleasant woodland and streams. However, it was the site of one of the worst atrocities of the Italian occupation 
      in 1937. Fascist troops attacked and destroyed the monastery, killing 297 monks, over 100 deacons, and at least 400 laypeople.

      On the side of the church, a 15-minute uphill trek across the river leads to the location believed to be where Saint Tekle Haimanot prayed.
